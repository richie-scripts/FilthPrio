# Filth Prio

Filthy Prio adds information to the item tooltip containing any loot priorities set for the item.

This should speed up loot distribution for guilds running on a loot council system.


To use:

Hovering the cursor over an item will display who is next in line for the specific item in accordance to the loot priority list.

Holding down the alt key will display additional information such as loot council notes and who has already received the item.

 

Edit the loot priority in the file 'PRIO_LIST_PHASE1.lua' until I have time to add an in game edit.
